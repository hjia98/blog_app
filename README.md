## Project Description

This Flutter project leverages the power of the Flutter SDK to build a cross-platform application that runs seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices. It incorporates a range of dependencies to enhance the functionality and user experience of the app.

The project follows the Clean Architecture principles, which promote a clear separation of concerns and enable easy testing, maintainability, and scalability. It is structured into distinct layers: presentation, domain, and data. The presentation layer handles the UI and user interactions, the domain layer contains the business logic and use cases, and the data layer manages the data sources and repositories.

The Bloc pattern is employed for state management, allowing a unidirectional flow of data and ensuring a reactive and predictable app state. The Flutter Bloc library is used to implement the Bloc pattern efficiently.

To provide a seamless offline experience, the project utilizes Hive, a lightweight and fast key-value database. When the device loses internet connectivity, the app retrieves data from the local Hive database, allowing users to access previously fetched data even in offline mode.

The project utilizes the Cupertino Icons package to provide a set of high-quality icons in the iOS style, ensuring a native look and feel on iOS devices. The FPDart package is used to bring functional programming concepts to Dart, enabling more expressive and concise code.

For backend integration, the project relies on Supabase Flutter, a powerful open-source alternative to Firebase. Supabase provides a complete backend solution, including authentication, database management, and real-time updates.

The Get It package is employed as a lightweight and powerful dependency injection framework, making it easy to manage dependencies throughout the app.

The Dotted Border package is used to create visually appealing dotted borders around UI elements, enhancing the overall design aesthetic. Image picking functionality is implemented using the Image Picker package, allowing users to select images from their device's gallery or capture new photos using the camera.

To generate unique identifiers, the UUID package is utilized, ensuring data integrity and preventing conflicts. The Intl package provides internationalization support, enabling the app to adapt to different locales and languages.

The Internet Connection Checker Plus package is employed to monitor the device's internet connectivity status, allowing the app to handle network-related scenarios gracefully. Isar Flutter Libs, a high-performance database solution for Flutter, is used alongside Hive for efficient data management.

Lastly, the Path Provider package is used to access commonly used locations on the device's file system, such as the documents directory, enabling efficient file management and storage.
